Thank you for being a Keychain member.
Weâ€™re writing to inform you that you have 
signed up successfully. 

I was hoping you wouldn't mind giving a bit
of feedback about your Keychain experience. 

    feedback@superkeychain.com

Thanks in advance, and if you have any questions 
or comments directly for me then just let me know.
